# About this project

I create this repository as a practice in using Playwright for automation testing webapps.<br>For this project I decided to use and test my own site, www.stephengunawan.com. This site is a personal blog about investing. In it I wrote about company updates, investing tips and tricks, as well as my thought processes when assessing company values and investment opportunities.

## Testing Scope

- Homepage
- Login Page
- Comment Section
- Accessibility
- Performance

## What I Learned

- Setting Up Playwright Project
- Using Playwright systems and methods
- Reducing test flakiness
- Overriding readonly properties to input credentials
- Using Lighthouse to audit site performance and accessibility
- Using Markdown syntax

## Next Steps

I will use grouping feature in Playwright to create smoke test for my site everytime I update it or adding new features.
